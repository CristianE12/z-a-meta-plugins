# ZI Annex `META-PLUGINS`

### **Wiki:** [z-a-meta-plugins](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/z-a-meta-plugins)

## Rationale

It can be tiring to:

1. Constantly, over and over collect some new interesting plugins to install/load.
2. Over and over reconstruct the new findings on the new machines.
3. Constantly extend and tweak the ice list of each plugin, so that it's hard on
   eyes, especially for an outsider.

## Recommended to start with

```zsh
zi light-mode for \
    z-shell/z-a-meta-plugins

zi light-mode for annexes \
    zsh-users+fast
```

## Install example of 22 plugins

```zsh
# Installs total of 22 plugins
zi for annexes zsh-users+fast console-tools fuzzy
```

### **â€¦ and also have the curated, optimal ice lists automatically applied !**
